    <h1>French Onion Soup</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/French-Onion-Soup.jpg"/>
    <p>I’m so excited to share this French Onion Soup recipe with you because I have adored, yes, absolutely adored French Onion Soup since I was a child. I would order this soup at every restaurant that my family would go to. I would compare the flavors and think about which one I liked best. I would pick off the crispy cheese around the ceramic bowl when the soup was finished.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul >  
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil regular</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>4 cups sliced onions Vidalia variety is preferred or yellow onions</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups dry white wine I used Sauvingon Blanc*I know this seems like a lot of white wine and you can cut back on the amount of wine if you want but I find that it gives that nice distinct “tang” flavor that French onion soup is know for</li>
            <li>6 cups beef broth get the best quality you can find (I use organic), plus more if you want to adjust the flavor later</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons fresh thyme or about 10 sprigs plus more for garnishing</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves *bundle the thyme with the bay leaves with kitchen twine</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt or amount to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper amount to taste</li>
            <li>1 French baguette bread 8-10 1-inch slices</li>
            <li> 4-6 slices of provolone cheese</li>
            <li> 4-6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li> 4-6 slices Muenster cheese</li> 
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch Oven or large soup pot, melt butter and olive oil over medium heat, add garlic and onions. Stir until they are translucent (about 10 minutes). Add salt, sugar and 1/4 tsp black pepper, stir and continue to cook until the onions are a golden brown or darker caramelization, if you prefer (35 minutes).</li>
        <li> Add the wine and the sherry and turn the heat up to high. Stir and reduce the liquid until there's almost none (about 10 mins).</li>
        <li> Add the beef broth add the bundled thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer for 20-30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning, if you want. At this point, you can continue to finish the soup or chill overnight, I find the flavor best the 2nd day.</li>
        <li> Place your rack so that the top of the bowls will be several inches from the heat source so that the cheese doesn't burn (I do the 3rd rack down in my oven). Heat your broiler, on a rimmed baking sheet, place 4-6 heat safe bowls, ladle the soup into the bowls, place 1 slice of 1 variety of cheese cheese over the soup, place 2 1-inch thick baguette slices on top of the cheese. Place 2 more slices of the other 2 varieties of cheese on top. Cook the soup bowls under the broiler for about 1 minute. Make sure to stay and watch it cook so that you can get the desired amount of crispiness for the cheese and so that it doesn't burn. When the bowls are done, top with more fresh ground black pepper and a thyme sprig for garnish and enjoy!</li>
